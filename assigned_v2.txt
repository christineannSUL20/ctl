Q(qualaid): You probably qualify as indigent because you receive public assistance. 

Q(qualciv): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 125% of the poverty line. There is a rebuttable presumption that a person is indigent and unable to pay a fee or fees or the cost of service of process if the person receives public assistance or the person's income after taxes, mandatory wage deductions, and child care expenses, is 125% (one hundred twenty-five percent) or less of the federal poverty level. (Section 52-259b of the Connecticut General Statutes.) So, you may be eligible to have your court fees waived. Would you like me to open up a fee waiver for you to file?

Q(qualcrim): You probably qualify as indigent since you earn less than 125% of the poverty line. (Section 52-259b of the Connecticut General Statutes.) So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer by the judge. 

Q(qualbut): You probably qualify as indigent but able to contribute since you earn between 125% and 250% of the poverty line. So you'll likely be assigned a lawyer and asked to pay a small fee. 

Q(noqualciv): You probably won't qualify as indigent since you earn more than 125% of the poverty line. So you'll probably need to hire an attorney. Would you like to search for one near you?
